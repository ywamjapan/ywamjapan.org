The School of Biblical Studies (SBS) at YWAM Takatsuki is a Japanese/English bilingual 10-month immersive course within Youth with a Mission, University of the Nations. It is designed to teach the students how to study the 66 books of the Bible through an inductive approach - to observe what the text says in the correct context, interpret and then make it applicable today. Students will not only be able to read a book and discover the big picture, but also be able to examine the finer details within each paragraph and verse. 

In this SBS we will study the Bible chronologically, from Genesis to Revelation, and discover how the biblical books form one connected story. Throughout the SBS, students will live in community with those who have the same passion for unlocking the beautiful mysteries of the Word. And staff are on hand to assist in the growth of the students - their understanding of the Word, how the inductive method is being used to further that understanding, and how that new understanding can be practically applied to their everyday lives.
